## Heart Disease Data Analysis

This project explores a heart disease dataset to identify key risk factors and build predictive models. The aim is to analyze health attributes that may influence the likelihood of developing heart disease.

### Dataset

The dataset includes patient medical records with attributes such as:

* Age

* Sex

* Chest pain type

* Resting blood pressure

* Cholesterol level

* Fasting blood sugar

* ECG results

* Maximum heart rate

* Exercise-induced angina

* ST depression & slope

* Number of major vessels

* Thalassemia status

* Target (presence or absence of heart disease)

### Objectives

Analyze how age and gender affect heart disease risk

Study the role of cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate

Identify patterns in ECG, angina, and other indicators


### Tools

* Python

* Pandas, NumPy

* Matplotlib, Seaborn





Hyperparameter tuning
